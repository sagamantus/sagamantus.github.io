about: |
    Hello, I'm Sagar Mankoti, a CSE undergrad from Indian Institute of Information Technology Kalyani.
    While my primary focus is on Backend Development, I'm also passionate about exploring various other
    aspects of computer science like Network Engineering, Compilers, Operating System, UI/UX and 
    Cloud-based Technologies. 

    Every other day, a new technology catches my eye and I dive right into it. Hence, I learn something 
    new everyday. I believe in use from books, articles, and documentation over video tutorials. 

    I was a part of the core team of Google Developer Students Club of IIIT Kalyani where I polished my 
    skills of webscraping, UI/UX and website development. I also had a chance to organise an in-person 
    hackathon named *statusCode 0* where I played the role of a Technical Manager. I was involved in 
    designing the hackathon's website, scraping hacker data, managing judges and assisting on field.

    Apart from coding, I enjoy sketching (probably not the best but I try), reading manga, and watching
    anime.

    PS: Lately, I'm using LunarVim and hold the ancient knowledge of how to exit Vim!
